According to available data, a significant portion of internet users believe existing measures are inadequate and there needs to be more active intervention to address this growing problem.\n\nSupporting findings from the data provided show that a majority of teens in the U.S. (59%) have experienced some form of cyberbullying, with name-calling (42%) and rumor-spreading (32%) being the most common forms. Furthermore, the perception of teens on the effectiveness of various entities in tackling cyberbullying highlights critical deficiencies: while many believe parents are doing an acceptable job, teens are notably critical of the efforts made by social media companies. This sentiment is echoed globally, with an Ipsos survey in April 2018 revealing that 76% of respondents felt that cyberbullying measures were insufficient and required special attention.\n\nIn conclusion, the aggregate data suggests that social media platforms are falling short of effectively combating cyberbullying. The extensive occurrence of online harassment and the prevalent public opinion calling for more robust measures indicate a need for social media companies to enhance and enforce stronger anti-cyberbullying policies globally.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2430, "completion_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 2661}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_c9aa9c0491", "annotation": {"relevance": "3", "faithfulness": "3"}}, "lama_llm_answer": {"id": "chatcmpl-22e371ed321d45ae86765e759e0b2913", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1723061579, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided statistics, it can be concluded that social media platforms are not doing enough to prevent cyberbullying.\n\nThe data suggests that a significant majority of teens (59%) in the United States have experienced some form of cyberbullying, with name-calling and rumor-spreading being the most common forms of harassment.
