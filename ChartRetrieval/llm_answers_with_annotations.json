Additionally, data from the United States as of February 2019 further emphasizes this trend, with 43 percent of U.S. adult women using Instagram compared to only 31 percent of U.S. adult men. This significant gap reinforces the observation that women tend to engage with Instagram more than men in this region.\n\nContrarily, in Latin America from June to August 2018, the gender usage statistics were nearly on par, with 23 percent of men and 22.6 percent of women reporting usage of Instagram. This close figure indicates that in certain regions, like Latin America, the gender discrepancy in Instagram usage might not be as pronounced. Nevertheless, on a global scale, the overall trend seems to favor greater female usage.\n\nIn conclusion, despite regional variations, the data points to a general trend where women are more likely to use Instagram than men. This pattern is significantly evident in both global and U.S. data, though less so in Latin America where the usage rates are almost equal across genders.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2623, "completion_tokens": 257, "total_tokens": 2880}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_c9aa9c0491", "annotation": {"relevance": "3", "faithfulness": "3"}}, "lama_llm_answer": {"id": "chatcmpl-23272d4adb7c45d793bb9b2d7a1476fb", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1724605431, "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided statistics, it can be classified that women are more likely to use Instagram than men, but the margin of difference varies across different regions and studies.\n\nA closer examination of the data reveals that globally, as of October 2020, women accounted for 51% of Instagram audiences, while men made up 49%. This 2% difference suggests a slight inclination towards women using the platform more. However, in Latin America, the difference is minimal, with 23% of male respondents and 22.6% of female respondents using Instagram in 2018. On the other hand, in the United States, the gap is more pronounced, with 43% of female respondents and 31% of male respondents using Instagram as of February 2019. This discrepancy may be attributed to regional and cultural differences in social media usage patterns.\n\nIn conclusion, while the data suggests that women are more likely to use Instagram than men, the difference is not drastic and varies across regions. The global average shows a slight bias towards women, but the Latin American data indicates a near-even split, and the US data shows a more significant difference.
