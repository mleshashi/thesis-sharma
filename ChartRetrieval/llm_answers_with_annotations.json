For instance, a median of 81% of respondents from several countries view international trade as beneficial for their respective economies, and 74% believe foreign companies establishing factories is advantageous. This sentiment is echoed within the United States, where 66% of Americans believe that greater involvement in the global economy is beneficial, primarily because it opens up new markets and growth opportunities. These findings indicate a strong positive perception of globalization's role in driving economic growth by enhancing market opportunities, fostering competition, and encouraging innovation.\n\nHowever, there are nuances and mixed feelings regarding the overall impact of globalization. In Belgium, the public opinion is somewhat divided; about 52% of respondents view globalization fairly positively, and 13% see it as very positive for economic growth. Contrarily, around 31% have negative views, including 23% with fairly negative and 8% with very negative sentiments regarding globalization's role in economic opportunities. This dichotomy emphasizes the existence of recognized downsides, such as potential increases in economic inequality, exposure to economic uncertainty, and environmental concerns. Despite these reservations, the majority perspective suggests an acknowledgment of the economic benefits derived from globalization, albeit with some guardedness about its broader impacts.\n\nIn conclusion, the overall statistical data suggests that globalization is perceived as a positive driver for economic growth, supported by substantial percentages in favor from various countries.
